# Restling 
A lightweight, powerful, and easy-to-use REST client library for .NET 9.

## Overview
The goal of Restling is to provide a flexible yet easy-to-use REST client API. While it's true that there are plenty of REST client libraries out there, Restling wants to stand out by focusing on stability and offering support for uncommon features, such as cookie injection. It is also designed to integrate seamlessly into dependency injection-based projects as a transient service.

## Why the name "Restling"?

While chatting with a friend, the name came to mind as a pun combining "REST" and "Changeling," the Fae beings from Northern folk tales. Restling is a library that has taken on the form of a REST clientâ€”though its journey started as something entirely different.

## Supported versions of DotNet

Restling supports both the latest .NET version and the latest LTS version, ensuring compatibility and stability for a wide range of projects.

*LTS Version:* .NET 8.0
*STS Version:* .NET 9.0
